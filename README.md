# Polynomial Regression From Scratch

Polynomial Regression from Scratch â€“ This project implements polynomial regression without using built-in polynomial transformation methods. The transformation is manually implemented using combinations of feature multiplications, and the model is trained using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`.

## ðŸ“Š Project Features:
- âœ… **Manual polynomial feature expansion**
- âœ… **Dynamic degree selection** (2, 3, 4, ...)
- âœ… **Feature selection and data preprocessing**
- âœ… **Train-test split** (80-20)
- âœ… **Mean Squared Error (MSE) analysis**
- âœ… **Training Error vs Test Error Graph**

## ðŸ“‰ Training vs Test Error

The graph below visualizes how the training error compares with the test error for different polynomial degrees, helping to identify overfitting and underfitting:
